# Wavelet-Decomposed Deviation Network (WDDN): Compact Time Series Anomaly Detection

This repository contains the code for the Wavelet-Decomposed Deviation Network (WDDN) model, which is a compact time series anomaly detection model. The WDDN model is based on the Deviation Network (DevNet) model, developed by [Guansong Pang, Chunhua Shen, Anton van den Hengel](https://github.com/GuansongPang/deviation-network). The WDDN model uses wavelet decomposition to extract features from the input time series data and then uses deviation subnetworks to detect anomalies in the time series data.
